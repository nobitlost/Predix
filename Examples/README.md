# Electric Imp Smart Refrigerator

Create a connected refrigerator using an Electric Imp and the Predix IoT platform.

## Overview
Skill Level: Advanced

Below are detailed steps on how to connect an Electric Imp with environmental sensors to the Predix Platform in order to visualize and monitor your refrigerator in real time.

## Ingredients - what you need

### General
  - Your WIFI *network name* and *password*
  - A smartphone (iOS or Android)
  - A computer with a web browser

### Accounts
  - An [Electric Imp developer account](https://ide.electricimp.com/login)
  - A [Predix account](https://www.predix.io/registration/)

### Hardware
  - An Electric Imp Explorer kit - [purchase here](https://store.electricimp.com/collections/featured-products/products/impexplorer-developer-kit?variant=31118866130)

And if you want to install the board into a fridge:

  - 3 AA Batteries

### Software
 - The Electric Imp BlinkUp app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/electric-imp/id547133856) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electricimp.electricimp))
  - [Agent code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.agent.nut)
  - [Device code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.device.nut)
  - [Predix web application](./PredixWebApp/electric_imp_smart_fridge) files
  - [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
  - [CF Predix](https://github.com/PredixDev/cf-predix)

## Step-by-step

### Step 1 - What is demonstrated in this example?
Use an Electric Imp to collect temperature, humidity and light sensor data.  Analyze the sensor data to determine if your refrigerator compressor is working properly and to track if your refrigerator door has been left open.  Upload data to the Predix IoT platform to monitor and visualize your refrigerator in real time.

### Step 3 - Connect your Electric Imp to the Internet

#### Set Up Hardware

1. Plug the Imp001 into the Explorer Kit Board
2. Power up your Imp with the AA batteries.

![Explorer Kit](http://i.imgur.com/6JssX74.png)

When the imp is first powered on it will blink amber/red.

#### Electric Imp BlinkUp

Use the Electric Imp mobile app to BlinkUp your device

1. In the app log into your Electric Imp developer account
2. Enter your WIFI credentials
3. Follow the instructions in the app to BlinkUp your device

When BlinkUp is successful the imp will blink green and the app will show you the device's unique ID.

For more information on BlinkUp visit the Electric Imp [Dev Center](https://electricimp.com/docs/gettingstarted/blinkup/).

### Step 4 - Connect your Electric Imp to Predix IoT

- In your web browser log into the [Electric Imp IDE](https://ide.electricimp.com/login) using your Electric Imp developer account.
- Click the **+** button to create a new model
![Empty IDE](http://i.imgur.com/Ui7w8eG.png)
- In the pop-up enter the following information:

1. A name for your code model (ie Smart Refrigerator)
2. Select the checkbox next to your device ID, this assigns your device to this code model
3. Click **Create Model** button

- Copy and paste [Predix Smart Refrigerator agent code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.agent.nut) and [Predix Smart Refrigerator device code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.device.nut) into the agent and device coding windows.
![IDE code windows](http://i.imgur.com/yiCmQZu.png)

- Scroll to the bottom of the agent code to find *Predix account constants* variables.
  - Enter the following values from **Step 2** into the corresponding variables:
    - [**UAA URL**](#uaa-url)
    - [**Client ID**](#client-id)
    - [**Client secret**](#client-secret)
    - [**Asset URL**](#asset-url)
    - [**Asset Zone ID**](#asset-zone-id)
    - [**Time Series Zone ID**](#time-series-zone-id)
  - For the **TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL** copy the [**WEB_APPLICATION_URL**](#web-application-url) value prefixed by "https://" and postfixed by "/ingest_data".

  It should look like <a id=time-series-ingest-url>

  `const TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL = "https://electricimp-smart-fridge.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/ingest_data";`

- Click **Build and Run** to save and launch the code
![IDE with code](http://i.imgur.com/lnoCtKR.png)

Take note of your **device ID** specified in the bottom left corner. It can be useful on the next step.

### Step 5 - Refrigerator data visualization

- Open your [**Web Application URL**](#web-application-url) prefixed by "https://" in your web browser.
- Select your device ID from drop down list and click **Sensors Data**.
- On the device page you can see the current temerature and humidity values, door status and alerts over the past hour.

### Step 6 - Install the Imp in your Refrigerator

Open your refrigerator and place the Imp on a shelf in the door.

![Imp In Fridge](http://i.imgur.com/z5llZBg.png)

### Step 7 - Optional Improvements

Your refrigerator is now connected to the internet. As you begin to gather data for your refrigerator you should adjust the static variables in your device SmartFridgeApp class to further customize your integration.

* Adjust the temperature, humidity, and lighting thresholds to optimize for your frigde
* Adjust the reading and reporting times to optimize power usage

### Troubleshooting guide

If you have any problems with Predix Smart Refrigerator agent code execution, try to localize it and check your 
Predix account settings and constants depending on the error:

- if your Smart Refrigerator demo doesn't log '[Agent] Dev created' message and 
  - fails with error '[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 401'
    - check [**CLIENT_ID**](#client-id), [**CLIENT_SECRET**](#client-secret) and [**ASSET_ZONE_ID**](#asset-zone-id) 
      constants values from Predix accout constants section of your agent code
    - go back to your **UAA Service instance** page in your web browser (you may need to log back in)
      - choose **your client**
      - ensure your client contains **Asset service instance name** in [**Authorized Services**](#uaa-authorized-services)

  - fails with error '[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 404'
    - check [**ASSET_URL**](#asset-url) and [**UAA_URL**](#uaa-url) constants values from Predix accout constants section of your agent code

- if your Smart Refrigerator demo logs '[Agent] Dev created' message but then periodically fails during ingestData execution
  - fails with error '[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 404' 
    - check [**TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL**](#time-series-ingest-url) constant value from Predix accout constants section of your agent code
  - fails with error '[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 400'
    - check [**TIME_SERIES_ZONE_ID**](#time-series-zone-id) constant value from Predix accout constants section of your agent code
    - go back to your **UAA Service instance** page in your web browser (you may need to log back in)
      - choose **your client**
      - ensure your client contains **Time Series service instance name** in [**Authorized Services**](#uaa-authorized-services)
      - ensure your client [**Scopes** and **Authorities**](#uaa-scopes-authorities) contain valid values `timeseries.zones.<Time Series Zone ID>.ingest`

If you have any problems with the web application
  - try to relaunch the web application using a terminal command `cf push -f manifest.yml`
  - if the web application fails with 'HTTP request failed with status ...' error
    - check manifest.yml [**clientId**](#client-id) and [**clientSecret**](#client-secret) parameters
    - go back to your **UAA Service instance** page in your web browser (you may need to log back in)
      - choose **your client**
      - ensure your client contains **Asset** and **Time Series** service instance names in [**Authorized Services**](#uaa-authorized-services)
      - ensure your client [**Scopes** and **Authorities**](#uaa-scopes-authorities) contain valid values `timeseries.zones.<Time Series Zone ID>.query`

After making any Predix account modification, relaunch the web application using a terminal command 

`cf push -f manifest.yml`

# Electric Imp Smart Refrigerator

Create a connected refrigerator using an Electric Imp and the Predix IoT platform.

You will use an Electric Imp impExplorer&trade; Kit to collect temperature, humidity and light sensor data. This data will be analyzed to determine if your refrigerator compressor is working properly and to track if your refrigerator door has been left open.  Upload data to the Predix IoT platform to monitor and visualize your refrigerator in real time.

**Important Note**:
The provided example is for illustration purposes. It can be used as a starting point for use-case specific integrations.

### Step 2 - Connect your Electric Imp impExplorer Kit to the Internet

#### Set up the hardware

1. Plug the imp001 card into the impExplorer Kit board.
2. Power up your device with the three AA batteries.

![Explorer Kit](http://i.imgur.com/6JssX74.png)

When the imp is first powered on it will blink amber if it has not been used before.

#### Electric Imp BlinkUp&trade;

Use the Electric Imp mobile app to configure your device for Internet access:

1. In the app, log into your Electric Imp account.
2. Enter your WiFi network credentials.
3. Follow the instructions in the app to connect your device using BlinkUp.

When BlinkUp is successful, the imp will blink green and the app will show you the device’s unique ID:

For more information on BlinkUp, pleasevisit the Electric Imp [Dev Center](https://electricimp.com/docs/gettingstarted/explorer/blinkup/).

### Step 3 - Connect your Electric Imp impExplorer Kit to Predix IoT

- In your web browser, log into the [Electric Imp IDE](https://ide.electricimp.com/login) using your Electric Imp account credentials.
- Click the ‘+’ button to create a new model:
![Empty IDE](http://i.imgur.com/Ui7w8eG.png)
- In the dialog, enter the following information:

1. A name for your code model, ie. "Smart Refrigerator".
2. Select the checkbox next to your device ID &mdash; this assigns your device to this code model.
3. Click the ‘Create Model’ button.

- Copy and paste the [Predix Smart Refrigerator agent code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.agent.nut) and the [Predix Smart Refrigerator device code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.device.nut) into the agent and device code panes:
![IDE code windows](http://i.imgur.com/yiCmQZu.png)

- Scroll to the bottom of the agent code to find the Predix account constants.
  - Enter the following values from Step 1 into the corresponding spaces:
    - [**UAA URL**](#uaa-url)
    - [**Client ID**](#client-id)
    - [**Client secret**](#client-secret)
    - [**Asset URL**](#asset-url)
    - [**Asset Zone ID**](#asset-zone-id)
    - [**Time Series Zone ID**](#time-series-zone-id)
  - For the **TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL** copy the [**WEB_APPLICATION_URL**](#web-application-url) value prefixed by "https://" and postfixed by "/ingest_data".

  It should look like this:<a id=time-series-ingest-url>

  `const TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL = "https://electricimp-smart-fridge.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/ingest_data";`

- Click ‘Build and Run’ to save and launch the code:
![IDE with code](http://i.imgur.com/lnoCtKR.png)

Take note of your device ID, as specified in the bottom left corner. It can be useful in the next step.

### Step 4 - Refrigerator Data Visualization

- Open your [**Web Application URL**](#web-application-url) prefixed by "https://" in your web browser.
- Select your device ID from drop-down list and click ‘Sensors Data’.
- On the device page, you can see the current temperature and humidity values, door status and alerts over the past hour:
![Predix Web App](http://i.imgur.com/SU2du1n.png)

### Step 5 - Install the Electric Imp impExplorer Kit in Your Refrigerator

Open your refrigerator and place the impExplorer on a shelf in the door:

![Imp In Fridge](http://i.imgur.com/z5llZBg.png)

### Step 6 - Optional Improvements

Your refrigerator is now connected to the internet. As you begin to gather data for your refrigerator you should adjust the static variables in your device SmartFridgeApp class to further customize your integration.

* Adjust the temperature, humidity and lighting thresholds to optimize for your fridge.
* Adjust the reading and reporting times to optimize power usage.

### Troubleshooting

If you have any problems with Predix Smart Refrigerator agent code execution, try to localize it and check your 
Predix account settings and constants, depending on the error:

- If your Smart Refrigerator demo doesn’t log an "[Agent] Dev created" message, and 
  - fails with error "[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 401":
    - Check the [**CLIENT_ID**](#client-id), [**CLIENT_SECRET**](#client-secret) and [**ASSET_ZONE_ID**](#asset-zone-id) 
      constants values from the Predix account constants section of your agent code.
    - Go back to your ‘UAA Service instance’ page in your web browser (you may need to log back in)
      - Choose your client.
      - Ensure your client contains your Asset service instance name in [‘Authorized Services’](#uaa-authorized-services).

  - fails with error "[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 404":
    - Check the [**ASSET_URL**](#asset-url) and [**UAA_URL**](#uaa-url) constants values from the Predix account constants section of your agent code.

- If your Smart Refrigerator demo logs the "[Agent] Dev created" message but then periodically fails during ingest data execution, and 
  - fails with error "[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 404":
    - Check the [**TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL**](#time-series-ingest-url) constant value from the Predix account constants section of your agent code.
  - fails with error "[Agent] ERROR: Predix request failed with status code: 400":
    - Check the [**TIME_SERIES_ZONE_ID**](#time-series-zone-id) constant value from the Predix account constants section of your agent code
    - Go back to your **UAA Service instance** page in your web browser (you may need to log back in)
      - Choose your client.
      - Ensure your client contains your Time Series service instance name in [‘Authorized Services’](#uaa-authorized-services).
      - Ensure your client’s [‘Scopes’ and ‘Authorities’](#uaa-scopes-authorities) sections contain valid values, ie. `timeseries.zones.<Time Series Zone ID>.ingest`.

If you have any problems with the web application:
  - Try to relaunch the web application using the terminal command `cf push -f manifest.yml`
  - If the web application fails with an "HTTP request failed with status ..." error:
    - Check the `manifest.yml` [**clientId**](#client-id) and [**clientSecret**](#client-secret) parameters.
    - Go back to your UAA Service instance page in your web browser (you may need to log back in), then:
      - Choose your client.
      - Ensure your client contains Asset and Time Series service instance names in [‘Authorized Services’](#uaa-authorized-services).
      - Ensure your client [‘Scopes’ and ‘Authorities’](#uaa-scopes-authorities) contain valid values, ie. `timeseries.zones.<Time Series Zone ID>.query`.

After making any Predix account modification, relaunch the web application using the terminal command 

`cf push -f manifest.yml`
